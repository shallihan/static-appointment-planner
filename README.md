# Static Appointment Planner

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and uses functional React components to create a web app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments. This project was to demonstrate an understanding for React Hooks.

You can see this web application up and running using [Surge](http://appointment-planner.surge.sh)
